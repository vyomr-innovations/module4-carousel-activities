       <span className="font-bold text-[#3674B5]"> But here is what I came to Masterman to tell you: nobody gets to write
        your destiny but you. Your future is in your hands. Your life is what
        you make of it.</span> And nothing – absolutely nothing – is beyond your reach.
        So long as you’re willing to <span className="font-bold text-[#3674B5]">dream big.</span> So long as you’re willing to
        <span className="font-bold text-[#3674B5]"> work hard.</span> So long as you’re willing to <span className="font-bold text-[#3674B5]">stay focused on your education.</span>
        That last part is absolutely essential – because an education has never
        been more important. I’m sure there will be times in the months ahead
        <span className="font-bold text-[#06923E]"> when you’re staying up late cramming for a test, or dragging yourselves
        out of bed on a rainy morning, and wondering if it’s all worth it.</span> Let
        me tell you, there is no question about it. Nothing will have as great
        an impact on your success in life as your education. More and more, the
        kinds of opportunities that are open to you will be determined by how
        far you go in school. In other words, the farther you go in school, the
        farther you’ll go in life. And at a time when <span className="font-bold text-[#890189]"> other countries are
        competing with us like never before; when students around the world are
        working harder than ever, and doing better than ever;</span> your success in
        school will also help determine America’s success in the 21st century.
